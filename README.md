# Flair

Import assets, configure them, and place them wherever desired, all on Quest Standalone.

This mod is in early development with **no public releases available.**
Still want to help with the plans and steer it towards being the best mod that it can be?
Discussion is open on the [Flair Discord server!](https://discord.gg/T3jZghYQ)

Use `qpm s build` to build
Same goes for `qpm s copy` and `qpm s qmod`
